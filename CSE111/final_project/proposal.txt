CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

    Baricenters Visualized

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    math, tkinter

5. List the names of functions you will need?
    main()
    file_to_dict(filename, index)
    calc_barycenter(body_one, body_two)
    create_body(mass, au)

    + whatever functions may be needed to show GUI

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
    test_file_to_dict()
    test_calc_barycenter()
    test_create_body()
